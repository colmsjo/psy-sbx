# psytoolkit

Getting started:

```
man psycc
man psyquest
psycc -h
psycc -s
psyquest -h
psyquest -s
psyquestcollect -h
```

Compile scripts with: `psycc -V -t test.psy`. `-V` shows the output of the compiler (which otherwise isn't showed!)
and `-t` prevents the compiler from making the script owned by `root`.



## Installation

Running Linux Mint xfce version 19.

Had to do `sudo sudo apt-get install -y ruby-dev libgtk2.0-dev rake` 
and then: `sudo gem install gtk2`
